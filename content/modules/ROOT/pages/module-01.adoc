= Create a network report automation job template

Learn how to create a network report job template in automation

== Lab 2 - Infrastructure Awareness

This lab will walk you through using Automation controller to create some *Dynamic Documentation* to retrieve and display information about a Cisco CSR (cloud services router) running IOS-XE.


== Lab Diagram

* The lab diagram for this demonstration is very simple.  There will be one Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 device running automation controller.  It is directly connected to the management network for a Cisco CSR (cloud services router) running IOS-XE.

== Quick Automation Victories

Infrastructure Awareness is a great introductory use case for network operators because it is:

* Read-only, no changing of production configs
* Normalizes configs into structured data
* Provides valuable information via Dynamic Documentation

== Automation controller

Automation controller provides a standardized way to define, operate, and delegate Ansible automation across the enterprise. It includes a Web User Interface (WebUI) that we will be using for this challenge.

== Job Templates

Everything in Automation controller revolves around the concept of a *Job Template*.  Job Templates allow Ansible Playbooks to be controlled, delegated and scaled for an organization.

Job templates also encourage the reuse of Ansible Playbook content and collaboration between teams.

* A Job Template requires:
+
** An *Inventory* to run the job against
** A *Credential* to login to devices.
** A *Project* which contains Ansible Playbooks

== Challenge 1 - Creating a Network Report Job Template

For this challenge exercise you are going to create a Job Template in Automation controller.  We are going to use the Network Toolkit Collection (https://github.com/network-automation/toolkit) that contains multi-vendor playbooks for creating a network report, backups, and more.

The *credentials* (username and password), *inventory* (a single Cisco router) and *project* (the network toolkit repository listed above) are already added.  We simply need to tie them together into a simple re-usable Job Template for our organization to use.

== Lets get started

That is the end of of your lab briefing!

For this exercise we are going to create an automation job on Automation controller

=== Login to automation controller

* To login to automation controller select the `Automation controller WebUI` tab at the top of your screen.
+
Login with the following credentials:

+
[%autowidth.stretch,width=70%,cols="^.^a,^.^a"]

* You will see a list of *Job Templates*.  Job templates encourage the reuse of Ansible playbook content and collaboration between teams.

* Click the blue Add button and select *Create job template*

* Assign the following values
