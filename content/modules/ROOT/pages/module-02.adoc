= Infrastructure Data Gathering with Ansible
:toc:
:toc-placement: preamble
:icons: font

== Introduction 📊

Sometimes you just need data about your systems, and Ansible is perfect for this task! While Ansible can automate almost everything, one of the best starting points is gathering infrastructure data.

You know you have servers, networks, and other infrastructure components, but auditing or gathering all the system data can be a massive exercise. Fortunately, you can use Ansible at scale to make this process efficient and automated.

== Lab Exercise 1: Discovering Server Information


=== Overview
Let's start by gathering detailed information about our servers using Ansible's built-in fact-gathering capabilities.


=== Step 1: Access Your Inventory

. Navigate to your lab `aap` tab and login with the credentials above
. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Infrastructure* → *Inventories*
+
NOTE: This is where we track all the systems we automate. You'll see several inventories already configured for you.

. Select the *Video Platform Inventory*
. Click on the *Hosts* tab

=== Step 2: Run Ad-Hoc Commands for System Facts

We'll use Ansible Automation Platform's ability to run ad-hoc commands to gather system facts and data.

. Select the host: `node01`
. Click on *Run command*
. From the module dropdown list, select the *Setup* module
. Click *Next*

=== Step 3: Configure Execution Environment

. Select the *Default execution environment*
. Click *Next*

TIP: In Ansible Automation Platform, we use Execution Environments to launch templates and playbooks. This provides consistent, containerized environments for our automation.


=== Step 4: Choose Credentials

. Select the *Application Nodes* credential
. Click *Next*
. Click *Finish*


=== Step 5: Review System Facts

Once the command executes, you'll see comprehensive system facts displayed.

This output contains all the information that Ansible can gather from the system, including:

* Hardware specifications
* Operating system details
* Network configuration
* Storage information
* And much more!

== Lab Exercise 2: Scaling Up - Infrastructure Reports


=== Overview
We need infrastructure awareness across our entire environment! With Ansible, creating dynamic reports based on facts and tasks is straightforward. Let's create comprehensive infrastructure reports.


=== Step 1: Generate Application Server Report

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Execute the *Application Server Report* template
. When prompted with options, select *All*


=== Step 2: View the Generated Report

. Once the template completes, navigate to the *Report Server* tab
. Refresh the page to see the generated report

Notice that the report includes backup information as well!

=== Step 3: Create Custom Reports

You can re-run the report template and choose different options to create reports based on specific criteria:

* Filter by server type
* Focus on specific metrics
* Generate reports for particular time periods
* Create targeted reports for different teams

== Lab Exercise 3: Security Compliance Reporting

=== Overview
Reports are valuable for operations teams, but InfoSec teams love them even more! Let's run an OpenSCAP compliance report to satisfy security requirements.

Security has requested a compliance report for `Node02`. Let's generate this critical security documentation.

=== Step 1: Run OpenSCAP Compliance Scan

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Execute the *OpenSCAP Report* template
. Wait for the job to complete

=== Step 2: Review Compliance Results

. Once completed, navigate to the *Compliance Report* tab
. View the generated compliance folder

.Compliance Report Folder

=== Step 3: Analyze Compliance Details

Click on the report to view detailed compliance results:

.Detailed Compliance Report

The report will show:

* ✅ **Passed** - Compliant controls
* ⚠️ **Failed** - Non-compliant controls requiring attention
* ℹ️ **Informational** - Additional security information
* 🔍 **Manual** - Items requiring manual verification

=== OpenSCAP Automation Implementation

Here's the key Ansible code used for OpenSCAP compliance scanning:
